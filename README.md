# Quadratics-Calculator
Calculates information of a quadratic function


I made these programs a few years ago (the completion dates of each of the programs are listed in the info.txt)

I had originally made these in TIBasic on my calculator while I was bored in school but decided to make a version with more functionality
These programs were both made by me with the debugging help of @theriley106 on GitHub who is one of my friends from High School

These are intended to be used to help in cases where you just need to find the answer. I do not condone cheating and please do learn the concepts so that you can do well in your class.

Enjoy!
